Nov.20 Basical idea has been established.
  HFiles & Calibration are basically work.
  Histograms & Detectors should be modified.
  Histograms ... Make of Histogram.h was so slow.
                 Histograms should be defined by object? like hist->Define(HISOGram) or in some way?
                 Then it can avoid to re-make and can be library
  Detectors ...  Is it good way to define physical value in this class?
                 Like Psd.energy or Psd.timing
                 then it can easily be treated.

  Modified a lot.
  It seems much better than before.
  Next thing is to let it make tree and graphs
  graphs perhaps is better to be created when loop was done, because it can not afford to manage such a lot of
  data due to array.(it seems that data plots are just an array)
  Is there way to avoid it?
  if so, I should create the macro or some another prgram to manage graphs.
