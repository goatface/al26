# Change these defaults as you like:
#   OFF: Leave undefined rather than '0' 
#          e.g. 'pflag=' means ppac data are OFF
#   ON:  Use '1' (or the correct Run number for Rval)
#          e.g. 'pflag=1' means ppac data are ON
#          e.g. 'Rval=3' means Run number 3
# Warnings: 
#   'Rflag=1' with 'Rval=' will just make run quit
#   Rval is meaningless without Rflag=1
# Call run in non-interactive mode Batch mode (needs Rflag and Rval defined)
